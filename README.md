## Laptop Price Prediction - Regression

This project aims to predict laptop prices based on various features and specifications using machine learning algorithms. By leveraging regression techniques, the model can provide estimated prices, helping customers make informed purchasing decisions.

### Libraries Used

- **pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **numpy**: Numerical operations
- **matplotlib**: Data visualization
- **seaborn**: Statistical data visualization
- **scikit-learn**: Machine learning algorithms and tools

### Project Steps

1. **Importing Data**: Loaded the dataset containing laptop specifications and prices.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzed the data to understand the relationships between different features and the target variable (Price).
3. **Feature Engineering**: Created new features and transformed existing ones to improve the model's predictive power.
4. **Modeling**: Built and trained various regression models, including Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest, to predict laptop prices.
5. **Results**: Evaluated the performance of the models using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
